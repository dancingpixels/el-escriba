<!--more-->

If you work with data in any capacity, whether you are a wrangler, an analyst, a scientist, part-time  analyst or an occasional statistician, you will do yourself much good by committing to heart the following maxims:

> Design experiments to reveal insights inherent in data instead of tweaking data to reveal what ever insight you desire.

>Frequently *chop off the tails* to prevent *outliers* from skewing the results of your analysis.

>*Correlation* usually does not imply *causation*.

>Rows are cheap, but columns are expensive.  

>Sometimes data doesn't have any significant insight apart from what common sense reveals.

> It is easier to stir people to action by telling them a compelling story from your findings than throwing lots of impressive analytical jargon at them.

Many rules of similar kind abound, but you'll discover them as you climb the ladder of wisdom and experience.

Farewell data explorer.
